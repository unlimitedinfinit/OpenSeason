System Instructions: Architecting "Open Season" (The Fraud Hunter’s Toolkit)

You are to build "**Open Season**," a high-stakes, local-first desktop application designed to turn citizens into bounty hunters using the False Claims Act. The goal is to help users track government fraud, secure their evidence, and prepare for a payday without getting caught in the crossfire. The technology stack is decisive and non-negotiable: use **Tauri 2.x** (RC or Stable) with a **Svelte 5 + TypeScript + Vite** frontend, styled using **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn-svelte**. The backend logic, referred to as the "Armory," must be written in **Rust**. For the critical "Kill Kit" (Disclosure Statement) generation, you must use **Typst** in library mode (via the `typst` crate) to ensure professional, LaTeX-quality output and stability; do not use `genpdf` or `lopdf` as they are effectively unmaintained in late 2025. Use `rusqlite` for a local SQLite index of targets, `reqwest` (with the json feature) for scouting HTTP requests, `tauri-plugin-fs` for strictly scoped file system access, `zip` for creating portable case bundles, and `rust-crypto` components—specifically `chacha20poly1305` for encryption, `argon2` (the RustCrypto version) for key derivation, and `zeroize` for securely wiping sensitive memory.

This app operates on a **Zero-Trust Hunting Blind** philosophy. Adhere to a strict local-first rule where evidence never leaves the hunter’s machine in plaintext and absolutely no cloud storage is used—any leak burns the bounty. Security is enforced via **Session-Only Authentication**: the app must require a Master Password on every launch that is never stored on disk. This password is used solely to derive the encryption key via Argon2id for the current session; if the app closes, the key is wiped from memory using the `zeroize` crate. The application must feature a "Legal Airlock" on startup—a mandatory, full-screen blocking modal displaying the strict legal disclaimer provided below. The user must explicitly type "I UNDERSTAND" to bypass this screen. After the Airlock, the user should be presented with a **Vault Launcher** screen that lists existing hunts (with metadata like target name and date) and offers a "New Hunt" button. Encryption is fixed to XChaCha20Poly1305 using a random 192-bit nonce; the user is not given a choice in this matter.

Organize the codebase by strictly separating the "Hunter’s UI" from the "Ballistics Lab" (Rust backend). In `src-tauri/src`, create specific modules: `commands.rs` for sensitive operations; `crypto.rs` for locking down the loot using the session key and handling zeroization; `pdf.rs` for the Typst-based disclosure statement builder; `usaspending.rs` for "Target Verification" (validating contracts >$100k via `api.usaspending.gov`); and `db.rs` for the SQLite metadata index, using a Multi-Vault architecture where each hunt has its own isolated folder and database. Critically, implement a `bundle.rs` module to handle the **"Bug Out Bag"** protocol. This module manages Exporting a specific hunt’s folder (database + encrypted evidence) into a `.osb` (Open Season Bundle) ZIP file and Importing `.osb` files back into the vault, ensuring full cross-platform portability while keeping the chain of custody secure. In the frontend `src/` folder, manage the UI with components for the "Hunt Wizard," "Trophy Vault," and "Transport" (Export/Import UI).

You must configure **Tauri v2 Permissions** correctly using the capabilities system. Do not rely on `tauri.conf.json` for permissions. Instead, create a `src-tauri/capabilities/main.json` file. inside this file, grant permissions using the specific v2 identifiers: `fs:allow-read-text-file`, `fs:allow-write-file`, `fs:allow-create`, and `fs:allow-exists`. Each of these must be strictly scoped using the `allow` array with the pattern `[{ "path": "$HOME/.open-season/**" }]`. You must also explicitly register the plugin in `main.rs` via `.plugin(tauri_plugin_fs::init())` and add `tauri-plugin-fs` to your cargo dependencies. Initialize the project using the standard `npm create tauri-app@latest` command with the SvelteKit template, then install `shadcn-svelte`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, and `svelte-french-toast`.

Execute the build in this specific MVP order: First, establish the project scaffold, the `capabilities/main.json` permissions, and the blocking "Legal Airlock" modal with the disclaimer text ("Open Season is free, open-source software provided AS-IS... This software is NOT legal advice"). Second, implement the Master Password/Argon2id flow and the file encryption/saving logic in `crypto.rs`, ensuring sensitive variables are zeroized after use. Third, implement the "Bug Out Bag" logic in `bundle.rs` to ensure you can Export and Import hunts immediately. Fourth, build the Svelte Wizard and connect it to the `usaspending.rs` verification. Finally, finalize the Typst PDF generation for the Disclosure Statement.
